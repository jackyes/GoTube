## Usage  
To get started, you need to have Go installed on your machine. Then, you can clone the repository to your local machine and run the server.  

    Modify the config.yaml file to fit your needs
    Modify users.yaml
    Run the code with the following command: go run main.go
    Access the file upload page at http://<server-ip>:<port>/ or https://<server-ip>:<port>/ (if TLS is enabled)
    
Optionally, you can disable TLS and bind the server to "127.0.0.1" so that it is only accessible from localhost then expose it as an onion service through TOR.  
  
## Docker  

It is possible to use an image on Docker Hub with the following command:

    docker run -p 8085:8085 --name gotube -v /home/user/users.yaml:/users.yaml -v /home/user/config.yaml:/config.yaml -v /home/user/uploads:/uploads -v /home/user/converted:/converted jackyes/gotube  
    
`/home/user/config.yaml` is the path to your config.yaml file (copy and edit the one in this repository).  
`/home/user/users.yaml` is the path to admin user/password config file users.yaml (copy and edit the one in this repository)  
`/home/user/uploads` is the folder where uploaded videos will be stored.  
`/home/user/converted` is the folder where the uploaded videos will be converted.  
change the default port 8085 accordingly with the one in config.yaml if you modify it.
  
### Build Docker image yourself  
It is possible to create a Docker container following these steps:  
Clone the repository  

    git clone https://github.com/jackyes/GoTube.git  
    
Edit the config.yaml file  
  
    cd GoTube
    nano config.yaml
  
Create the Docker container  
  
    docker build -t gotube .  
  
Run the container  
  
    docker run -p 8085:8085 gotube
